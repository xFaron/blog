## Who Am I?

Hey, this is Harikrishna. A brief background : I am an undergrad in Computer Science at IIT Hyderabad, 18 yrs old. Currently, just got done with my freshman year as I write this. 

I'm an amateur programmer, mostly focusing on C++ and Python right now, trying to get into Competetive programming (CP), and learn more about Computer science research. At the same time, I'm trying to talk to more people, deal with my academics and build a more healthy and sustainable life style. 

To all my readers, I want to tell you about why I am blogging.

## Why Am I Blogging?

As a student, the best thing that I have discovered is that learning brings me pleasure. Such immense pleasure that I would go out of my way, skipping movie nights with friends, missing on wonderful moments of life just to get one more extra hour of study time. My friends ask me "How do you just live in the library all the time?" , and my answer is "That's just me".

So, to all the true nerds out there, they know what I am talking about. And, at the same time, the next best thing that I have discovered is teaching or helping my fellow mates. There is no greater satisfaction than realising that your mate understood a concept because you explained it to him, and not because of the teacher : )

So, with all of this in mind, I am blogging to teach people what I know. At the same time, this kind of blogging will help me record all my experiences in the tech domain. Kinda like a diary entry in somesense, now that I think about it 

## What to Expect

What will I be blogging about? I'll be covering anything and everything that interests me, and which is tech. Currently, I am trying to get into CP, learning Fuzzing techniques, and if time allows, learn DSA. So, you can expect that

For the occasional reader they can consider this as a learning journal, where I share my 'aha' moments and frustrations.

You can expect a new post every Sunday, with additional posts whenever time permits. While this schedule may adjust occasionally, I'm committed to maintaining at least weekly posts.

## Let's Connect

If you guys want to contact me, the preferred medium would be an email at cs24btech11030@iith.ac.in. As time goes by, I will update this section with my social media handles as well.

Thanks for reading!

PS : I am still trying to improve the look and feel of the site. Although I am not a CSS fan, I will try my level best to make everything look clean. I will make these changes with each new blog. Stay tuned!
